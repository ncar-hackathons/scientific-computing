    "\n",
    "- In Python, the end of a physical line marks the end of most statements. Unlike in othe programming languages such as C, C++, Python statements **are not normally terminated with a delimiter**, such as a semicolon (`;`). \n",
    "- When a statement is too long to fit on a single physical line, you can join two adjacent physical lines into a logical line by ensuring that the first physical line has no comment and ends with a backslash (`\\`)\n",
    "- Python also joins adjacent physical lines into one logical line if an open parenthesis(`(`), bracket (`[`), or brace (`{`) has not yet been closed. \n",
    "- Python uses indentation to express the block structure of a program. Unlike other languages, Python does not use braces or being/end delimiters around blocks of statements:\n",
    "  - Indentation is the only way to indicate such blocks\n",
    "  - All statements in a block must have the same indentation\n",
    "  - Python style is to use four spaces per indentation level"

    "## Identifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "- An **identifier** is a name used to identify a variable, function, class, module, or other object.\n",
    "- Normal Python style is to start class names with an uppercase letter and other identifiers with a lowercase letter.\n",
    "- Starting an identifier with a single leading underscore indicates by convention that the identifier is meant to be private.\n",
    "- Starting an identifier with two leading underscores indicates a strongly private identifier; if the identifier also ends with two trailing underscores, the identifier is a language-defined special name.\n",
    "- The identifier `_` (a single underscore) is special in interactive interpreter sessions: the interpreter binds `_` to the result of the last expression statement evaluated interactively, if any."
