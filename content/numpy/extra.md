# Summary

In this tutorial, we've given a brief introduction to array-based programming with Python's NumPy Library. NumPy is a core library that provides a foundation for nearly all computational libraries for Python. Familiarity with the NumPy library and its usage patterns is a fundamental skill for using Python for scientific computing. The NumPy library is the topic of several books, including the Guide to NumPy, by the creator of the NumPy T. Oliphant, available for free online at http://web.mit.edu/dvp/Public/numpybook.pdf, and *Numerical Python (2019)*, and *Python for Data Analysis (2017)*.
